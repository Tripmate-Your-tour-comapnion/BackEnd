## GitHub Workflow Rules

### Branching Structure:
- **Clone and Checkout**: All team members must clone the repository and start their work by checking out from the `test` branch. This ensures a consistent starting point for all new development work.
- **Feature Branches**: Individual features or tasks must be developed on separate branches. These branches should be prefixed with `feature/`, followed by a descriptive feature name. For example, if you are working on the login page, the branch should be named `feature/login-page`. This naming convention helps in identifying the purpose of each branch easily.

### Merging Workflow:
- **Communication**: Before merging any feature branch into the `test` branch, team members must communicate with their peers. This step is crucial to ensure smooth integration and to resolve any potential conflicts that might arise from concurrent work on the codebase.
- **Readiness for Merge**: Merging into the `test` branch should only be done when the feature is fully developed and tested. This ensures that the `test` branch remains stable and functional at all times.

### Pull Requests and Commit Messages:
- **Pull Requests**: When a feature branch is ready to be merged into the `test` branch, team members must create a pull request (PR). This PR serves as a formal request to merge changes and allows for code review and discussion.
- **Pull Request Titles**: The title of the pull request should succinctly describe the feature or task being merged. It should give reviewers a clear understanding of the scope of changes at a glance.
- **Commit Messages**: Commit messages accompanying the pull request must be meaningful and descriptive. Each commit message should provide clear information about the changes made, why they were made, and any other relevant context. This practice facilitates better understanding and tracking of the project's history.
